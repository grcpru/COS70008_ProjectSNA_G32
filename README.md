**Social Network Analyzer (SNA) Desktop Application**

The "Social Network Analyzer (SNA) Desktop Application" is a sophisticated yet user-friendly tool designed for analyzing social networks. The project, titled "Design and Implementation of a Cross-platform Desktop Application for Social Network Analysis using Statistical Models," aims to deliver a powerful desktop application to facilitate advanced social network analysis across diverse contexts.

**Project Overview**

The SNA Desktop Application leverages statistical models such as Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to enable users to analyze social network data comprehensively. Key features of the application include:

- Data Collection and Upload: Users can collect and upload network data seamlessly through the application's intuitive interface.
- D-Tale Integration: D-Tale is integrated into the application for comprehensive data exploration. Users can leverage D-Tale's interactive interface to explore datasets in detail, gaining insights and identifying patterns before performing network analysis.
- Statistical Models: The application utilizes ERGMs to provide in-depth analysis of network properties and outcomes, allowing users to gain insights into complex network structures and dynamics.
- Descriptive Statistics Algorithms: Users have access to descriptive statistics algorithms, enabling them to explore various aspects of the network data.
- Interactive Network Visualization: Network structures are visualized using NetworkX, providing users with interactive visualization tools to explore and analyze network connections effectively.
